# Telegram-UserBot

![](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/HitaloKun/TG-UBotX.svg?label=Repo%20size&style=flat-square)

A modular Telegram UserBot running on Python 3.6+ with an sqlalchemy database.

If you just want to stay in the loop about new features or announcements you can join the [news channel](https://t.me/UBotX).

## Disclaimer
 
First of all you should know this bot is a major work in progress. It is a fork of [Paperplane Extended](https://github.com/AvinashReddy3108/PaperplaneExtended), If you choose to use this bot now, be prepared to pull changes frequently as I continue to fix broken english, pull or change things that don't make sense, or add new things.

I aim to bring back the legacy of Paperplane Extended, literally be an extended version of the [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot).
