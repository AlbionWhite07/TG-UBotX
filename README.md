## Telegram UserBot

A modular Telegram UserBot running on Python 3.6+ with an sqlalchemy database.

## Disclaimer
 
First of all you should know this bot is a major work in progress. It is based on [Paperplane Extended](), If you choose to use this bot now, be prepared to pull changes frequently as I continue to fix broken english, pull or change things that don't make sense, or add new things.

I aim to bring back the legacy of Paperplane Extended, literally be an extended version of the UserBot Paperplane (currently called Telegram UserBot only)
