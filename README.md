## Disclaimer
 
First of all you should know this bot is a major work in progress. It is based on [Paperplane Extended](), If you choose to use this bot now, be prepared to pull changes frequently as I continue to fix broken english, pull or change things that don't make sense, or add new things.

Currently work fine perfectly, but some features may give you error. Please report a bug to me if you facing any issues.
